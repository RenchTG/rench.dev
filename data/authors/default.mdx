Hi! I'm Philip, but go by the name Rench online. I'm currently a senior attending Rock Canyon High School waiting to see where college app decisions take me as a prospective CS major.

I'm interested in anything from competitive rock climbing to fantasy novels to computers. Right now, I spend most of my time in computer science, specifically cybersecurity and a little bit of software dev here and there.

My cybersecurity journey has mostly took the the form of Capture-the-Flag competitions (CTFs). I currently play with [View Source](https://ctftime.org/team/175828) and [Project Sekai](https://ctftime.org/team/169557), focusing on the categories binary exploitation and reverse engineering.
