Hi! I'm Philip, but go by the name Rench online. I'm currently a freshman at Georgia Tech studying CS.

I'm interested in anything from competitive rock climbing to drawing to computers. Right now, I spend most of my time in cybersecurity with a little bit of software dev here and there.

My cybersecurity journey has mostly taken the the form of Capture-the-Flag competitions (CTFs). I currently play with [View Source](https://ctftime.org/team/175828), [.;,;.](https://ctftime.org/team/222911), and [Project Sekai](https://ctftime.org/team/169557), focusing on the categories binary exploitation and reverse engineering. In the future, I hope to expand my horizons in the field and meet new people in the community.

Feel free to check out my [blog](/blog), where I'll be posting future writeups that I make as well as any other tidbits I come across and find interesting.
